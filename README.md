# SMS-spam-ham-detection-using-Naive-Bayes
Classify the SMS as either a SPAM or a HAM using Naive bayes Classifier


The aim of this project is to classify the SMS as either a SPAM or a HAM. The dataset has 5574 observations with one input feature as 'text' which is the SMS and one target variable called 'type' i.e Spam or Ham.

The type(Spam/Ham) are converted into numbers(1/0) to predict future SMS as either Spam or Ham

By usinf TF-IDF vectorization on text and applying Naive Bayes classifier, model was built to predict if a sms is spam/ham.
